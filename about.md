The Hulet group investigates atoms at temperatures as low as a few nano-Kelvin. At such low temperatures, the strange and fascinating effects of quantum mechanics dominate, greatly altering normal atomic behavior. Hulet and his group have used laser cooling and atom trapping techniques to explore this exotic regime of matter, investigating ultracold atom collisions, Bose-Einstein condensation, and pairing of atomic Fermi gases. Our current interest is the realization of fundamental models of condensed matter using ultracold atoms confined by optical lattices, the study of few-body physics of bosons with resonant interactions, and realizations of matter-wave solitons.
