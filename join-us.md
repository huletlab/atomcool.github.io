We have openings in our group for new members.  If you are interested in our graduate program, please apply via the Department of Physics and Astronomy website ([www.physics.rice.edu/](http://www.physics.rice.edu/)).


We have an opening for a Postdoctoral Research Associate in ultracold atomic physics.  The successful applicant will be a key member of our experimental program to use ultracold atomic fermions in optical lattices as a new platform to realize strongly correlated many-body states of matter. This position offers an excellent opportunity to conduct research at the forefront of the exciting field of ultracold atomic gases. A Ph.D. in relevant areas of experimental atomic or condensed matter physics is required. Qualified candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. R. Hulet ([randy@rice.edu](mailto:randy@rice.edu)) for further information.
